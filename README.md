# Bubble Pushers
Digital Logic Project - Implementing a MIPS processor in Verilog.

## Sample Programs
The assembly of the programs are located under the asm directory. You cannot run these directly, they must be converted to binary in a text file. We have included those as well called `prog1.bin` and `prog2.bin`. 

## How to Run
Include all the `.v` files in ModelSim and then compile. After a sucessful compile, simulate the CPU module. Then load the wave form called `cpu_run.do` under the `waves` directory. Add any outputs you want to see, then click Run All. You will see our program in all of its matrixy glory.
